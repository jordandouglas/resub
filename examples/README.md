# Resub examples

This directory describes the experiments performed in the main article accompanying this repository.


`simulation` contains scripts for simulating parameters, trees, and datasets under the resub model, and then doing inference using the same model, or a different one.

`benchmark` contains sixteen empirical datasets used to test the resub method.


`aaRS` contains two aminoacyl-tRNA datasets, each with both Classes joined together in a tree-of-life time calibration analysis.
